<h1>Kiez-Helper</h1>

Kiez Helper is a web app, that brings neighborhoods together by enabling neighbors in need of assistance to create requests for help on a responsive marketplace. 

Neighbors that are free and want to help can answer requests, and by that Kiez-Helper brings people in touch and helps to create a connected neighborhood that carries value in it's self.
