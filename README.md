<h1>Kiez-Helper</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

Kiez Helper is the second project of Ayumi Ienaga and me during the nine week web dev bootcamp and our first fullstack web application, which we mostly did in pair programming.

<h2> What is Kiez-Helper about?</h2>

Kiez Helper is a web app and social market place, that brings neighborhoods together by enabling neighbors in need of assistance to create requests for help on a responsive marketplace. 

Neighbors that are free and want to help can answer requests, and by that Kiez-Helper brings people in touch and helps to create a connected neighborhood that carries value in it's self.

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

We use HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Passport and a Node Mailer.
